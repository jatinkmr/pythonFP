Q1. why we create .venv directory inside our python project?
A1. We create a .venv (short for virtual environment) directory inside a Python project to isolate dependencies specific to that project. Hereâ€™s why it's useful and often recommended:
1.1 Dependency Isolation
Each Python project may require different packages or different versions of the same package. Creating a .venv ensures:
a) The project uses its own set of libraries, separate from system-wide Python packages.
b) Avoids version conflicts between projects.
1.2 Reproducibility
.venv makes it easy to:
a) Freeze installed packages to a requirements.txt file.
b) Ensure that collaborators or deployments install exactly the same versions using: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
1.3 Cleaner Environment
a) Keeps your global Python environment clean.
b) Prevents accidental interference between projects.
1.4 Portability (With Some Care)
While .venv itself isn't typically committed to version control, its presence signals:
a) The project is self-contained.
b) You should run:
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
1.5 Best Practice
Most modern tools (like Poetry, Pipenv, VS Code) use .venv or similar to manage environments, because it's the Pythonic way to maintain clean project structure.
